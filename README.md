# For this little movie recommender data from GroupLens was used, you can download the data from here https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/ (ml-latest.zip), so all credits goes to them for providing the data!
# Also thanks to the youtube channel 'Dataquest' for this idea and the basics how to implement this
# As a notice, this is just a private small project
# Further only run the main.py, and make sure, that the downloaded data and all files are in the same folder. 
# needed libraries are customtkinter, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, re, os
# At last, the menu at the left is not implemented, something for the future to do.
